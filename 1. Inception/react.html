<!-- This is a simple HTML file that demonstrates how to use React and ReactDOM to create a 
basic "Hello World!" application. The code includes the necessary CDN links for React and ReactDOM, 
and it uses JavaScript to create and render a React element. -->

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- Due to these CDN links, we can use React and ReactDOM in our HTML file. -->

    <!-- The below script is the core file of React library which is responsible for creating and managing React elements. -->
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
    ></script>

    <!-- The below script is the core file of ReactDOM library which is responsible for interacting with the DOM. -->
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>

    <!-- Why we have separate React and ReactDOM libraries? -->
    <!-- React is a library for building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is a library that provides DOM-specific methods that can 
    be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.
    Therefore we have separate React and ReactDOM libraries.
    We can use React in other environments as well like mobile apps (React Native), VR (React VR) etc. 
    For mobiles and VR we don't need ReactDOM as they don't have a DOM.
    In mobile we use React Native and in VR we use React VR.

    <!-- Now we can use React and ReactDOM in our HTML file. -->
    <!-- Next step is to print Hello World! using React. -->
    <script>
      // Create a React element
      // Syntax: React.createElement(type-of-tag, props-to-pass, children-to-pass-inside-the-created-tag)
      const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World! from React");

      // Create a root element (to interact with the DOM we use ReactDOM)
      // Syntax: ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") element)
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

      // Render the React element to the root element
      // Syntax: root.render(React element)
      root.render(heading);
    </script>

    <script src="./App.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
