# Parcel

Documentation: https://parceljs.org/

- Creates Dev Build
- Creates Local server
- Auto-refresh the page or HMR (Hot module replacement/reload)
- Parcel uses a file watching algorithm written in C++ (Keeps track of each save and re-build the code after save)
- Faster builds via Caching (present in .parcel-cache)
- Do Image optimization
- Minification of files for production build
- Bundling
- Compress all the files to reduce bundle size
- Uses consistent hashing
- Do Code splitting
- Do Differential bundling (To run our app smoothly on all kinds of browser irrespective of older or newer versions)
- Do diagnostic of the app behind the scenes
- Error handling and graceful error messages
- Gives Https capabilities
- Tree shaking (Remove Unused/Dead/stale code)
- Different dev and prod bundles

Under the hood, parcel also uses other libraries to do the above optimizations. All these above things makes our
React app faster and performant.
